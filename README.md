# Alright, lets do this one last time.

How this will work is that we will have two applications running at the same time. Idk if this will kill your laptop, but tell it that "Bryce Cayanan sends his regards"
One server will be running the React application at localhost:3000, while the other will be running django at localhost:8000

## How to run two servers

### Click on startserver.bat

This will start up the backend side

### npm start 

Now, open another console within this folder and then write 'npm start'.
This will start up the frontend side.


## Open localhost:3000 to view it in the browser
The page will reload if you make edits inside the "frontend" folder.
